# USB_Video_STM32F103CBTx
STM32F103CBTx example USB and VIDEO class

This example will create a "camera interface" in the windows "device manager" by USB. It is only to have a basic project to make the enumeration. There is no camera connected on my STM32F103. 

I use: 
STM32CubeIDE 1.14.0
CubeMX 6.10.0
STM32F103CBTx / USB FullSpeed
